# Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
# Code uses a stack to manage subarrays which need to be sorted. 
# The stack keeps track of subarray ranges through pairs of indices (l, h). 
# The function initializes the stack and pushes the initial range of the entire array onto it. 
# A loop repeatedly pops subarray ranges from the stack,applies the partition function to find the pivotâ€™s position, 
# and pushes subarray ranges onto the stack for further processing. 
# This loop continues until the stack becomes empty, indicating that all subarrays have been sorted.

# This function is same in both iterative and recursive

  #write your code here
  pivotElem = arr[h]
  i = l - 1
  
  for j in range(l, h):
    if arr[j] <= pivotElem:
      i = i+1
      arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
    
  arr[i + 1], arr[h] = arr[h], arr[i + 1]
  return i + 1
